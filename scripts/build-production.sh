## Built Applications
- âœ… Header MFE (apps/header-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Left Nav MFE (apps/left-nav-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Cart MFE (apps/cart-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Orders MFE (apps/orders-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Profile MFE (apps/profile-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Checkout MFE (apps/checkout-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Payment MFE (apps/payment-mfe/dist)
- âœ… Shell App (apps/shell-app/dist)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy each MFE to its respective production domain
2. Update the shell app's environment variables with production URLs
3. Deploy the shell app
4. Test the complete application

## Important Notes
- Ensure all production domains are accessible
- Configure CORS properly on all MFE servers
- Set up proper SSL certificates
- Configure CDN for static assets if needed
